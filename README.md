# Welcome
Hi! Welcome to **Fog Mod**! This is a mod that adds fog to every area in the game. I made it while working on the Patch Quest modding wiki, I found out that there was an easy and simple way to set the fog settings for different parts of the game, so I made this mod so that you can play with fog. I hope that this challenge is somewhat interesting, also if anyone manages to beat the game (true ending) with this I'll put their name in this list, you don't need proof, this is just a fun little challenge thing

# Planned Features
* Custom fog color
   * Change the fog color to whatever you want through config!
* Blindness mode
   * Full intensity fog that makes it impossible to see pretty much everything except things that appear on top of the fog normally (like outlines, and shots)
   * I'll also probably make a seperate leaderboard for this because this mode would be insane
   
# Leaderboard
* Example - March 5, 2023
